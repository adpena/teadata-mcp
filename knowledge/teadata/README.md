# TEA Data Engine

Unofficial Python toolkit for Texas public education data — spatially-aware, object-oriented, fast.  
It ships a cache-first “data repo” you can load in seconds, then query with clean, Pythonic primitives (including a fluent `>>` operator).

## Quick start

### 1) Clone & install (editable)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adpena/teadata.git
cd teadata
pip install -e .
```

> The editable install makes `import teadata` available and lets you iterate quickly.

### 2) Load the prebuilt snapshot

The engine will automatically discover a `.pkl` snapshot in either:
- `./.cache/` under your repository root, or
- `<site-packages>/teadata/.cache/` shipping with the library.

```python
from teadata import DataEngine

# Fast-path: load the latest discovered snapshot
engine = DataEngine.from_snapshot(search=True)

print(len(engine.districts), len(engine.campuses))
# -> e.g. 1207 9739
```

> If you prefer the implicit path: `engine = DataEngine()` also tries to auto-load a snapshot.

### 3) First query in 10 seconds

```python
# Retrieve district by TEA campus number (integer, digits only, or 6-digit left-zero padded string with leading apostrophe all work)
aldine = engine.get_district("101902")

# Retrieve district by district name (case insensitive - returns multiple results if there are multiple districts with the same name, such as "Northside ISD")
aldine = engine.get_district("Aldine ISD")

print(aldine)                 # District(...)
print(aldine.rating)          # canonical (may be enriched via alias)
print(aldine.overall_rating_2025)  # enriched attribute, if present

# Iterate campuses physically inside the district
for c in aldine.campuses:
    print(c.name, c.rating)
```

---

## What you get

- **Rich domain objects**: `District` with polygon boundaries; `Campus` with point geometry and canonical IDs.
- **Fluent query language**: chain filters/transforms with `>>` (details below).
- **Spatial acceleration**: nearest-k, containment, and district/campus lookups.
- **Config-driven ingestion**: add datasets by editing YAML/TOML; get schema checks and year-based resolution.
- **Enrichment**: attach new fields (e.g., accountability, finance) as dynamic attributes — and alias into canonical ones.
- **Reproducible caches**: build once into a `.pkl` “repo snapshot”, reload instantly next time.

---

## Data models

### `District`

Key fields & behavior:

- `id: UUID`
- `name: str`
- `district_number: str` — normalized **six-digit**, zero-padded, may be stored with a **leading apostrophe** to match TEA data where needed.
- `rating: Optional[str]` — canonical; can be synced from enrichment via alias
- `boundary: shapely.Polygon | MultiPolygon`
- **Computed / accessors**
  - `campuses: list[Campus]` — all campuses physically inside the boundary (spatial join is precomputed during repo build)
  - `nearest_campuses(...)`
  - `charter_campuses`: campuses with charter flag
  - Dynamic attributes from enrichment (e.g., `overall_rating_2025`)

### `Campus`

- `id: UUID`
- `campus_number: str` — normalized **nine-digit** TEA code (zero-padded; apostrophe-safe)
- `name: str`
- `enrollment: Optional[int]`
- `type: Optional[str]` — e.g. `"OPEN ENROLLMENT CHARTER"`
- `point: shapely.Point`
- `coords: tuple[float, float]` — `(lon, lat)` for convenience
- `district_id: UUID` — back-link to parent
- `district: District` — property resolving the back-link
- Dynamic enrichment fields (e.g., `overall_rating_2025`)

> **Normalization helpers** exist for both district/campus numbers; they’ll accept ints, strings with/without apostrophes, and coerce to canonical text forms.

---

## Query system (the `>>` operator)

The `Query` object wraps lists of `District` or `Campus` and supports fluent chaining via `>>`:

```python
# Start a query from a district TEA number, expand to campuses, then score
district_q = engine >> ("district", "101902")

top5 = (
    district_q
    >> ("campuses_in",)
    >> ("filter", lambda c: (c.enrollment or 0) > 1000)
    >> ("sort", lambda c: c.enrollment or 0, True)  # True -> descending
    >> ("take", 5)
    >> ("map", lambda c: (c.name, c.enrollment))
)

print(top5)  # list[(name, enrollment)]
```

Common operators:

- `>> ("campuses_in",)` — expand the current district query into its campuses
- `>> ("filter", predicate)` or `>> (lambda x: ...)`
- `>> ("sort", key_fn, descending: bool=False)`
- `>> ("take", n)`
- `>> ("nearest_charter", coords, mile_limit, k)` — from repo-level query context
- `first()` — take first element
- Attribute fall-through: `Query.attr` proxies to `first().attr` for convenience.

## Spatial tricks (`coords`, `within`, nearest)

### Using `coords`

Every campus exposes `coords` as `(lon, lat)`. This is handy for distance-based queries and pipelines:

```python
campus_q = (engine >> ("district", "101902")) >> ("campuses_in",)
c0 = campus_q.first()
k_nearest = engine.nearest_campuses(*c0.coords, limit=5)  # list[(Campus, miles)]
```

> The engine keeps a fast spatial index (STRtree, Shapely 2.x) for nearest-k and containment probes.

### `within` and `charters_within`

Two common helpers:

```python
# All campuses within a district boundary (inferred from the district query)
inside = ((engine >> ("district", "101902")) >> ("within", None)).to_list()

# Charter-only campuses within the same boundary
charters = ((engine >> ("district", "101902")) >> ("within", None, True)).to_list()

# Equivalent imperative helpers
inside_alt = engine.within(aldine, items="campuses")
charters_alt = engine.charter_campuses_within(aldine)
```

These use polygon containment and are validated by a built-in slow-path check to avoid false negatives.

### Nearest

```python
# Five nearest charters within 10 linear miles of a target point
pt = (-95.36, 29.83)  # (lon, lat)
nearest_charters = engine.nearest_campuses(
    pt[0],
    pt[1],
    limit=5,
    max_miles=10,
    charter_only=True,
)
```

## Enrichment pipeline

Bring in external datasets (accountability, finance, etc.) and attach fields directly to objects.

### Districts

```python
from teadata.enrichment.districts import enrich_districts_from_config
from teadata.teadata_config import load_config

CFG = load_config("teadata_sources.yaml")
year, updated = enrich_districts_from_config(
    engine, CFG, dataset="accountability", year=2025,
    select=["2025 Overall Rating"],
    rename={"2025 Overall Rating": "overall_rating_2025"},
    aliases={"overall_rating_2025": "rating"},  # also write canonical slot
)
print(f"Enriched {updated} districts from {year}")
```

### Campuses

```python
from teadata.enrichment.campuses import enrich_campuses_from_config

year, updated = enrich_campuses_from_config(
    engine, CFG, dataset="accountability", year=2025,
    select=["2025 Overall Rating"],
    rename={"2025 Overall Rating": "overall_rating_2025"},
    aliases={"overall_rating_2025": "rating"},
)
print(f"Enriched {updated} campuses from {year}")
```

### Snapshots

After enrichment, persist a reproducible repo:

```python
engine.save_snapshot(".cache/repo_<tag>.pkl")
# Later:
engine2 = DataEngine.from_snapshot(".cache/repo_<tag>.pkl")
```

Snapshots are versioned with a content signature. The loader can discover and pick the latest automatically with `search=True`.

## Config & data resolution

All external data locations and schema expectations are declared in a single YAML (or TOML) config.  
Highlights:

- **Per-dataset per-year** entries (2009+)
- **`latest`** and **`current`** shortcuts
- **Schema hints** (allowed file extensions per dataset)
- **Spatial layers** declared alongside tabular sources

Example (excerpt):

```yaml
year_min: 2009

data_sources:
  accountability:
    2025: data/accountability/2025-enhanced-statewide-summary-after-2023-appeal.xlsx
    latest: 2025

spatial:
  districts:
    2025: data/shapes/Current_Districts_2025.geojson
  campuses:
    2025: data/shapes/Schools_2024_to_2025.geojson

schema:
  data_sources:
    accountability: ["parquet","csv","xlsx"]
  spatial:
    districts: ["geojson","gpkg","parquet"]
    campuses: ["geojson","gpkg","parquet"]
```

**Programmatic access**

```python
from teadata.teadata_config import load_config
cfg = load_config("teadata_sources.yaml")

# Resolve “best” file for a year (exact match or nearest prior)
resolved_year, path = cfg["data_sources", "accountability", 2025]
print(resolved_year, path)

# Quick availability report
print(cfg.availability_report())
```

**Cross-dataset joins**

Use the provided helpers to normalize `district_number` and join TAPR/PEIMS/etc. without fighting column name variations.

## Performance notes

- **Shapely 2.x + STRtree** powers nearest and containment queries at scale.
- **One-time precomputation** during repo build: district ➜ campuses index, ID maps, clean normalizations.
- **Cache everything**: Snapshots persist the derived indices; reloads are **milliseconds**, not minutes.
- **Slow-path sanity check** on spatial containment can be toggled, and only runs when the fast path returns 0 where >0 is expected.

---

## Repo layout

- `teadata/classes.py` — models (`District`, `Campus`, `DataEngine`), query object, spatial index.
- `teadata/load_data.py` / `teadata/load_data2.py` — examples/scripts to build and snapshot repos from raw sources.
- `teadata/teadata_config.py` — config reader/validator (YAML/TOML), year-resolution, schema validation.
- `teadata/enrichment/` — modular enrichment functions (districts, campuses, charter networks, etc.).
- `.cache/` — binary snapshots (`repo_*.pkl`) for instant loads.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Where do snapshots live?**  
A: Prefer the package-internal `.cache/` for the “best known” snapshot. The loader also searches your repo root `.cache/`.

**Q: Does `district_number` need an apostrophe?**  
A: Normalizers accept either digits-only or apostrophe-prefixed strings and standardize internally.

**Q: Can I chain spatial + attribute filters?**  
A: Yes — use `>>` to compose: `engine >> ("within", d, "campuses") >> (lambda c: c.rating in {"A","B"})`.
